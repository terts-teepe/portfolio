          <h4>About Me</h4>
          <p class="left-align light">My official name is Felix Tertius Teepe, which means "the lucky third" in Latin, I am the third child of my parents so that explains my name. Most people know me as Terts, which is my nickname. I was born at 24th of july in 1991 and I have been living in Amsterdam since then. I have 2 brothers (Pim, who is 29 years old, and Ids, who is 22 years old). I do also have a sister, Joan, she is 27 years old. <br></br>

After I finished finshed my VWO at highschool 'Hervorm Lyceum Zuid' I took a gab year. Within this year I travelled together with my friend Mark for 5 months. We started in Hawaii, from there we went on to New-Zealand, China, Laos, Thailand, Cambodia and Indonesia. Last year, after I finished my Bachelor Degree in 'Beta-Gamma - Neuroschience' at the University of Amsterdam. Afterwards I went to South-America for about 5 months. During my travels I discovered that I like the art of photography a lot.  <br></br>

When I was 14 years old I went to Bamako (the capital city of Mali) by car together with my family. This is where I had my first experience with African music, I immediately fell in love with it. Thhis was a good reason for me to start collecing African records, eventually this resulted into a DJ-Carreer. I have been DJing in and around Amsterdam since 2010, my artist name as DJ/Producer is <a href="https://soundcloud.com/felixtapes"
  target="_blank">Felix Tapes </a>(you can click on the link to listen to my music if you're interested).
In between September 2016 and January 2017 I did a 4 month intensive 'Electronic Music Production' course at the 'SAE Institute' in Amsterdam. At the moment I am studying at the 'New York Code & Design Academy' to increase my skills in Web-Developing and coding in general.

            <h5 class="center">DJ Producer Felix Tapes</h5>

            <p class="light">Felix Tapes has been playing his favourite records in multiple nightclubs in and around Amsterdam since 2010. Being raised by two Africa lovers, African music influenced him since his childhood. Felix also travelled through South America a lot. Just listening to his sets and productions tells you how much the rhythms and grooves from these continents inspired him to create his own style. From Nigerian funk to Amazon tribe music, everything is possible.</p>

            <p class="light">Luckily I have seen many beautiful places and met a lot of wonderful people during my travels. Fascinated by the landscapes I've seen in Azia, Africa and South-America I started taking pictures. For now I am focussing on portrait and landscape photos. At the moment there are not many pictures online. Soon I hope to expose a collection of my work.</p>
